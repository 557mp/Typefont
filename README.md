# Typefont

Here I'm working on this algorithm that tries to recognize the font of a text in a photo.

## Why this poor readme?
Now I want to sleep but I promise that soon I will improve the description of everything and I will add more details.

##Â Usage
Ok so here I used it with my favorite Italian apple juice.

In the result I included a similarity percentage and a piece of information about each font.
