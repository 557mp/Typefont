# Typefont
Here I'm working on this algorithm that tries to recognize the font of a text in a photo.

## Why this poor readme?
Now I want to sleep but I promise that soon I will improve the description of everything and I will add more details.

## Usage
Ok so here I used it with my favorite Italian apple juice.

Text on the cover of a book.

In the result I included a similarity percentage and a piece of information about each font.

## Goal
My goal is to create a smartphone app that uses this engine to recognize fonts.
